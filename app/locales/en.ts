        answer: "I recommend checking out the YouTube channel @yoga_with_vlady — you'll find beginner-friendly hatha yoga and vinyasa flow classes there. The sessions are 20-30 minutes long with detailed explanations of technique and proper alignment.\n\nThe channel regularly uploads new videos to help you master yoga basics at a comfortable pace. Remember, consistency matters more than intensity — it's better to practice 15 minutes daily than one hour per week.",
