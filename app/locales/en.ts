The sessions are 20-30 minutes long with detailed explanations of technique and proper alignment.\n\nThe channel regularly uploads new videos to help you master yoga basics at a comfortable pace. Remember, consistency matters more than intensity — it's better to practice 15 minutes daily than one hour per week.",

He spent many years studying sacred texts under the direct guidance of Guru in India.",
